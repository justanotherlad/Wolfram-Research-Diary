> Self-Reading


> - Topic (4): Transfinite Arithmetic
>
> Lot of axiomatic theories and set theories involved. Due to lack of knowledge on Set Theory, couldn't understand as deeply, other than 
> 1. Any finite number can be expressed as ordinal or cardinal numbers (cardinal = size of set, ordinal = order of member of an ordered set)
> 2. Omega(w) is the lowest transfinite ordinal number.
> 3. Continuum hypothesis states there is no cardinal number between Aleph-naught (first transfinite cardinal number, i.e, cardinality of infiite set of natural numbers) and cardinality of set of Real Numbers. Hence Aleph-one is the cardinality of Real numbers.
> 3. Cantor normal form gives a representation of every ordinal number as a sum of powers (with coefficients) of Omega(w).
> Further Read: Ordinal Arithmetic, Axiom of countable choice

> ***Note***: http://blog.wolframalpha.com/2010/09/10/transfinite-cardinal-arithmetic-with-wolframalpha/
> ^^ probably one of the coolest blogs I've read. Changed the way how I look at infinity.
> WL seems to be not working for transfinite arithmetic when I tried in notebook. It might actually be a good idea to mplement tarnsfinite arithmetic in WL.
>
> ***Question for mentor***: Does WL FunctionRepository have any implementations of transfinite arithmetic currently?
> Further Read: Book Suggestionn by Abhirup on basics of Axiomatic theory from geomtric point of view: Robin Hartshorne er Euclid and Beyond
>
>
> Bugged Jonathana Gorard about Axiomatic systems.
(he suggested a book called ***Ken Kunen's Set Theory: An Introduction to Independence Proofs*** to study furhter about Axiomatic Set Theory ,
Ordinal Arithmetic, Transfinite Arithmetic and concepts of Continuum Hypothesis after WSS).
>
> ##### ***Note:*** Probably should also read ***Infinity and the MInd by Rudy Rucker*** after internship.

> - Topic 5:
>
> Looked a lot into Axiomatic systems and how they work. Bugged Abhirup with the same.
> wolfram /FindEquationalProof[] is a mind-blowing function, developed by Jonathan and team.
> Axioms of Truth- an interesting topic to ponder upon, maybe for Computational essay?

> #### HAD ONE-TO-ONE INTERACTION WITH STEPHEN WOLFRAM FOR ABOUT 30MINS IN TOTAL ABOUT DISCUSSION AND FINALIZING OF PROJECT TOPIC! (Highest point on career!? LMAO)
![1:1 Discussion with Stephen Wolfram on discussing and finalizing on my project](https://github.com/justanotherlad/Wolfram-Research-Diary/blob/master/photo_2020-07-02_23-27-34.jpg)
