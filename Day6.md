> Listened to lecture by Philip Maymin (CTO, ESDL) on Introduction to Wolfram Language. Probably one of the best lectures to get an idea why Mathematica might be
> so good for Research in Higher Mathematics.

> Had a short private convo with Philip on trade-offs of Mathematica's one-liners and compile-time incompetence. Why is Mathematica not accepted in most algorithmic
> competitions?

> Wolfram Lectures

> Made a WolframCloud with Jesse Friedman's (Wolfram Research) help with all the words Beatles has ever written. Christopher Wolfram pointed out they contain Lennon
> and McCartney's name, and I think that's because they wrote much more songs compared to Harrison (seen as small word in top-left corner), probably why Harrison split
> with Beatles?

> Attended Stephen Wolfram's private Q/A session.
> Asked him Who his fav. physicist was, and what's his best science theorem. Answers: Einstein, Einstein's Path Integral
