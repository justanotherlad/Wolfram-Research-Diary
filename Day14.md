> - Still Have some issues in division
> - [ ] PowerTower[{10, 10, 10, 2}]/PowerTower[{10, 10, 10, 10, 2}] doesn't work (gives 10^overflow. This overflow actually happens in addition,a special case)
> - [ ] PowerTower[{10, 10, 10, 2}]/PowerTower[{10, 10, 2}] gives erroneous result 
> - [ ] PowerTower[{10, 10, 10, 10, 2}]/PowerTower[{10, 10, 2}] gives erroneous result
