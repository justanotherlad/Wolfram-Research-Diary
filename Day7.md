> Watched the 2nd lecture by Philip Maymin. He's probably the BEST lecturer of Wolfram. I've already become a fan.

> Installed Ubuntu 20.04

> Watched Stephen Wolfram's lecture where he talked about his interactions with all famous people like Richard Feynman, etc.

> Came up with an idea to implement level-index arithmetic notation at 4am.
