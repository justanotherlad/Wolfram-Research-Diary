###### Project-proposals I had submitted while Application:
```
A) Title: Computational Methods for Analyzing Related Problems to Bertrand's Postulates

Abstract: 
         1. Goal - Bertrand's Postulate states that for n>1, there is always a prime number between n and 2n. This has been proved by Chebyshev
                   in 1850 and later improved by Erdos in 1932. However, a related problem is to find the least value of theta so that there 
                   exists at least one prime between n and n+O(n^theta) for sufficiently large n.
                   The smallest known value is theta=6/11+epsilon.
                   I would like to work on this problem and see if, through Mathematica, I could study the functions like Prime Number Counting
                   and Next Prime which are already available as functions in the Wolfram Language and discover some sort of patterns which might
                   arise through emperical investigation and find a better result for the same.

B) Title: Detection of Raga from a piece of Indian Classical Music using Wolfram Mathematica

Abstract: 
         1. Goal - In Indian Classical Music, there are over 1000 ragas that even Wikepedia does not classify, and each Indian Classical Piece
                   is based on one or more such Ragas. It is a difficult task to listen to one such piece and determine the raga manually, just by
                   expertise and experience, and your skill in Indian Classical Music can literally be determined by how much expert you are in
                   identifying a Raga by just listening to it.
                   My goal in this project is to develop a classification method using Wolfram Language such that by analyzing a raga and it's notes,
                   it can be determined upto a certain accuracy which Raga the piece might be based on.

 ###### *Ultimately, these proposals were probably too higher-ended, and probably sort of more of a Masters' Research Thesis than a 3-weeks' project. So ultimately was suggested to work on something else by mentors.*
