> Implemented representation part of my project. Representation works correctly in the new format.

> Had a chat with Sathvik Ajay (IIT-M). Helped me with a few syntaxes of WL and how to wrap up function body after function definition. Talked for quite a long
> time about various topics, including his project works, advantages of using Wolfram, why Mathematica might not be that famous yet, etc.

> Attended bits of ML lectures by Jesse and Tuseeta Banerjee, Wolfram Research.

> Mentor meeting for about 45mins. Got tips on parsing information of my function into an object class, as just printing is not helpful for performing arithmetic.
> Advice on reading more research papers.

> Played Chicken Scratch (developed by Mark) at night with Nik, Me and Antonia (on the same) team Vs Barbaba and Ahmed Elbanna.

> Constructed a separate function for power representation.
