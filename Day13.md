> Changed the radix back to what it was, and fixed the base to 10, i.e, no option for user to change the base.
> Found the following issues in my current notation:
- Doesn't work for PowerTowers like 10^10^10^10^10^10
- Cannot deal with PowerTowers like 10^2^1^9^8^7^2^6^4, where answer should actually be 10^2.

My next steps would be:
- [ ] Complete the functions listed as ToDos in the current notation as much possible, and see how non-integral power-tower works, and save it as current progress up till now.
- [ ] Read up the papers sent by mentor, and try to implement the classical level-index notation to do-away with all the issues.
- [ ] Implement HyperCalc's algo if nothing works.
- [ ] Examine non-integral power towers again after all these.
